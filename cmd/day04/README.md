# Camp cleanup

Identifies overlapping section assignments in:
[the cleanup roster](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4):

> Every section has a unique ID number, and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.
>
> However, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each other, they've noticed 
> that many of the assignments overlap. To try to quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated 
> effort, the Elves pair up and make a big list of the section assignments for each pair (your 
> puzzle input).

The file is read in from `stdin` up until `EOF`.
